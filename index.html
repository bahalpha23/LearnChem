              [cite_start]<p>The kinetic model of matter is a theory that describes matter as being composed of small particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) that are in constant, random motion[cite: 85]. [cite_start]The amount of kinetic energy these particles possess is directly related to the temperature of the substance[cite: 87]. [cite_start]Higher temperatures mean the particles have more energy and move faster[cite: 88].</p>
              [cite_start]<p>The temperature of a substance is a direct measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles[cite: 87, 97]. [cite_start]Temperature is commonly measured using the Celsius scale ($^{\circ}$C) or the Kelvin scale (K)[cite: 88, 98]. [cite_start]Absolute zero (0 K or -273.15 $^{\circ}$C) is the theoretical temperature at which all particle motion ceases[cite: 99].</p>

                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Explain why a gas in a sealed container exerts pressure.</strong><br>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Answer:</strong> The particles in a gas are in constant, random motion[cite: 85]. As they move, they collide with the walls of the container. The force of these collisions averaged over the area of the container walls is what we measure as pressure.</li>
                  <li><strong>How does an increase in temperature affect the motion of particles in a substance?</strong><br>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Answer:</strong> An increase in temperature provides the particles with more kinetic energy[cite: 87, 97]. This causes them to move faster and further apart from one another.</li>
                  <li><strong>Why does the smell of a perfume spread throughout a room?</strong><br>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Answer:</strong> The perfume particles mix with the air particles and, due to their constant, random motion, they diffuse from an area of high concentration (the bottle) to an area of low concentration (the rest of the room) until they are evenly distributed[cite: 5]. This is an example of the kinetic model in action.</li>
                  <li><strong>What is the relationship between temperature and particle kinetic energy?</strong><br>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Answer:</strong> Temperature is a direct measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles[cite: 87, 97]. If the temperature doubles in Kelvin, the average kinetic energy of the particles also doubles.</li>
                  <li><strong>Why do gases have a much lower density than solids?</strong><br>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Answer:</strong> In gases, the particles are very far apart and the intermolecular forces holding them together are weak[cite: 172, 182]. [cite_start]In solids, the particles are closely packed together in a fixed lattice[cite: 108]. This close packing in solids results in a much higher density compared to the widely dispersed particles in gases.</li>

              [cite_start]<p>The kinetic model is used to explain the different states of matter: solids, liquids, and gases[cite: 108]. [cite_start]The state of a substance depends on two main factors: the energy of the particles and the strength of the forces holding them together[cite: 108].</p>
              <ul>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Solids:</strong> Particles are arranged in a fixed, regular lattice structure and are held together by strong forces[cite: 108]. They only vibrate about their fixed positions and cannot move past one another. [cite_start]Solids have a fixed shape and volume[cite: 108].</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Liquids:</strong> Particles are randomly arranged and are held together by forces that are strong enough to keep them close, but weak enough to allow them to slide past one another[cite: 108]. Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container.</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Gases:</strong> Particles are far apart and move randomly and rapidly in all directions[cite: 108]. [cite_start]The forces between the particles are very weak[cite: 172]. Gases have no fixed shape or volume and will expand to fill their container.</li>

                  <li><strong>Describe the movement of water particles in a solid (ice), a liquid (water), and a gas (steam).</strong><br>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> In ice, particles are in a fixed lattice and only vibrate. In liquid water, they are randomly arranged but still close, sliding past each other. In steam, they are far apart and move randomly at high speeds.</li>
                  <li><strong>Why is it possible to compress a gas but not a solid or liquid?</strong><br>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Answer:</strong> Gas particles are widely spaced, so there is a lot of empty space between them[cite: 172, 182]. Solids and liquids have particles that are already closely packed, leaving very little space for compression.</li>
                  <li><strong>A beaker of water is heated. What happens to the particles in the liquid?</strong><br>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Answer:</strong> As the water is heated, the particles gain kinetic energy[cite: 87]. They move faster and further apart, causing the liquid to expand.</li>
                  <li><strong>How can the scent of a skunk be smelled from far away?</strong><br>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> The scent particles are released as a gas. [cite_start]According to the kinetic model, gas particles move randomly and rapidly[cite: 108], so they diffuse away from the source, mixing with the air and reaching our noses even at a distance.</li>
                  <li><strong>Why do gases and liquids both take the shape of their container, while solids do not?</strong><br>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Answer:</strong> The particles in gases and liquids are not in fixed positions and can move past each other[cite: 108]. This allows them to flow and conform to the shape of their container. The particles in a solid are in fixed positions, so the solid maintains its own shape.</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Melting:</strong> Solid to liquid. [cite_start]Particles gain enough energy to overcome the forces holding them in fixed positions and can slide past each other[cite: 108].</li>
                <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Liquid to gas. [cite_start]Particles gain enough energy to completely overcome the intermolecular forces and escape as gas particles[cite: 108].</li>
                <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> Liquid to solid. [cite_start]Particles lose energy and slow down, allowing the intermolecular forces to pull them into a fixed, regular lattice structure[cite: 108].</li>
